- ‚úÖ Security vulnerabilities fixed (React Native updated to 0.72.17)

## üõ†Ô∏è Next Steps

### For iOS Development

1. **Install Xcode** (if not already installed):
   - Download from Mac App Store or Apple Developer portal
   - Requires macOS and about 10GB of space

2. **Create iOS project** (one-time setup):
   ```bash
   # Navigate to project
   cd /Users/martingorol/Documents/AnimeTracking
   
   # Create iOS project structure
   npx @react-native-community/cli@latest init AnimeTrackingIOS --skip-install
   cp -r AnimeTrackingIOS/ios/* ios/
   rm -rf AnimeTrackingIOS
   
   # Install iOS dependencies
   cd ios && pod install && cd ..
   ```

3. **Run on iOS**:
   ```bash
   npm run ios
   ```

### For Android Development

1. **Install Android Studio**:
   - Download from https://developer.android.com/studio
   - During setup, install Android SDK and create a virtual device (AVD)

2. **Set environment variables** (add to ~/.zshrc or ~/.bash_profile):
   ```bash
   export ANDROID_HOME=$HOME/Library/Android/sdk
   export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/emulator
   export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools
   ```

3. **Start Android emulator** or connect physical device

4. **Run on Android**:
   ```bash
   npm run android
   ```

## üöÄ Quick Start (iOS Simulator)

If you have Xcode installed, you can quickly test the app:

```bash
# Make sure you're in the project directory
cd /Users/martingorol/Documents/AnimeTracking

# Run the iOS simulator
npm run ios
```

## üì± Testing the App

Once running:

1. **Login Screen**: Tap "Login with AniList"
2. **Authentication**: Authorize the app in the WebView
3. **Home Screen**: View your tracked anime list from AniList

## üîß Troubleshooting

### If iOS build fails:
```bash
cd ios
pod deintegrate && pod install
cd ..
npm run ios
```

### If Android build fails:
```bash
npx react-native doctor
# Follow the suggestions for missing Android components
```

### Clear cache if needed:
```bash
npx react-native start --reset-cache
```

## üéØ App Features

- **OAuth Authentication**: WebView-based AniList login
- **Anime List**: Displays tracked shows with cover art
- **Status Tracking**: Shows watching status (Completed, Watching, etc.)
- **Pull to Refresh**: Update anime list
- **Cross-platform**: Same code for iOS and Android

## üìã Project Status

Your project is **ready to run**! The main hurdle was the npm dependencies, which are now successfully installed. You just need to set up the mobile development environment (Xcode for iOS, Android Studio for Android) to build and run the app.

The app code is complete and includes:
- Authentication flow with AniList
- GraphQL API integration
- Beautiful UI with dark theme
- Deep linking for OAuth redirects
